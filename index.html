<h1>
What is Hackasaurus?
</h1>

<p>
The Web is the most ubiquitous communication medium of our age, and it's where many spend hours of their day for work and play. Yet few people understand its underlying structure; few know, for instance, that every page is composed of standard parts that no company owns. Few know that the composition is malleable: typos can be fixed, canvases altered, sounds spliced, annoyances removed, features added.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the Hackasaurus backpack is to provide a set of easy-to-use tools with an accompanying curriculum that give people the power to see how everything on the Web is put together, and that invite them to play with the Web and alter it to make it their own.
</p>

<p>
By making it easy to take apart, understand, and remix the fabric of the Web, we enable anyone to turn it into a space where they can represent and define their own identity; make informed decisions about their privacy and security online; protect the openness of this digital commons for future generations; and have fun creating instead of consuming.
</p>

<h2>
The Tools
</h2>

<p>
The Hackasaurus backpack is currently comprised of the following tools:
</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>

<strong>
Web X-Ray Goggles
</strong>
 - This tool allows anyone to easily "see through the surface" of any Web page, and obtain an intuitive understanding of how pages are composed. The goggles can be used anywhere on the Web one hangs out at&mdash;whether it's Facebook, the New York Times, 4chan, or someplace else. Casual use of this tool enables one to gain a rudimentary grasp of HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model.
</p>

</li>

<p>

<strong>
Mixmaster
</strong>
 - This is what people use after they've mastered the Web X-Ray Goggles. While goggles allow one to take apart a page and inspect its individual parts, the Mixmaster allows one to actually change parts to remix the page. For instance, the tool can be used to change the font that's used on a page, or to hyperlink a word on a page to its entry on Wikipedia. Each alteration is called a "hack" and hacks can be easily shared with friends for any purpose&mdash;to make a page, a site, or even the entire Web more usable, more hilarious, or more meaningful. Experimenting with this tool provides one with an understanding of domain names and CSS selectors; it also engages them in writing short snippets of HTML, which provides scaffolding for future adventures in Web development.

<h1>
Who Will Use Hackasaurus?
</h1>

<p>
We are developing the Hackasaurus backpack with teenagers as the core audience. However, we are creating resources that are flexible enough to be explored and implemented by learners of all ages.
</p>

<h1>
How Will Hackasaurus Be Created?
</h1>

<p>
We have compiled a core team of designers, developers, researchers, curriculum experts, educators and teens to develop tools for the community. The Hackasaurus backpack itself is a curated set of tools: some of them are developed by our core collaboration team of the New Youth City Learning Network, NYPL, YouMedia and Mozilla, while others are designed by the open source community.
</p>

<h1>
Where and When Will Hackasaurus Be Developed?
</h1>

<p>
Over the next six months, we will be developing prototypes of the Hackasaurus backpack, which will be user-tested and co-designed by youth in design jams in New York and Chicago.
