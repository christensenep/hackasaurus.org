  The Web is the most ubiquitous communication medium of our age, and itâ€™s where many spend hours of their day for work and play. Yet few people understand its underlying structure; few know, for instance, that every page is composed of standard parts that no company owns. Few know that the composition is malleable: typos can be fixed, canvases altered, sounds spliced, annoyances removed, features added.

  The goal of the Hackasaurus backpack is to provide a set of easy-to-use tools with an accompanying curriculum that give people the power to see how everything on the Web is put together, and that invite them to play with the Web and alter it to make it their own.

  By making it easy to take apart, understand, and remix the fabric of the Web, we enable anyone to turn it into a space where they can represent and define their own identity; make informed decisions about their privacy and security online; protect the openness of this digital commons for future generations; and have fun creating instead of consuming.
