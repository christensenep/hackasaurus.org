<h2>July 2010</h2>
<p>On July 16, Mark Surman, Atul, Ingrid, Taylor, Jack, and a number of others meet at the Macarthur Foundation headquarters in Chicago to discuss the possibility of integrating <a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2009/05/28/what-makes-the-web-better/">Open Web preservation</a> education into the pilot YOUmedia and NYPL initiatives. No artifacts exist from this meeting, but the notion of Atul teaching YOUmedia kids how to write HTML comes up, which leads Atul to create HTMLPad and blog about it in his post <a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/?p=1107">Prelude to Barcelona</a>.</p>
<h2>October 2010</h2>
<p>Atul and Mark discuss the value of teaching kids HTML to make web pages. Creating things from scratch can be intimidating for kids; perhaps creating tools and curriculum to empower kids to remix and modify the existing Web they live in every day would be more useful.</p>
<h2>November 2010</h2>
<p>During the <a href="http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/">Drumbeat Festival</a>, Taylor, Jack and Atul develop a tentative curriculum for a Web inspection+remix tool in public libraries and document it at the <a href="2010-11-05-etherpad.html">11-05 Etherpad</a>.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, Taylor presents on the project at the weekly Drumbeat meeting and much brainstorming occurs at the <a href="2010-11-22-etherpad.html">11-22 Etherpad</a>. This is the first time <i>Hackasaurus</i> is used to describe the project.</p>
<p>Late in the month, Atul creates a prototype for an inspection tool he calls <a href="https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/">Web X-Ray Goggles</a>; in early December he adds a 4-minute introductory screencast.</p>
<h2>December 2010</h2>
<p>On the 7th, Jessica and Atul create the <a href="2010-12-07-googledoc/">12-07 Google Doc</a> containing wireframes for the remix interface, as well as the first references to Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out.</p>
<p>The next day, Ingrid, Ben, Jack, Chris, Taylor, Jessica, Rafi, and Atul discuss the document and keep notes at the <a href="2010-12-08-etherpad.html">12-08 Etherpad</a>.</p>
